# BELPhaser

This real-time strategy WWII variant of StarCraft built using Phaser.js game engine is a simple yet interesting single player
campaign that requires users to coordinate attacks on incoming soviets that are surrounding an American stonghold in the heart
of Russia. The objective is to earn as many points possible by advancing american soldiers to the next round. Each round is 1 minute
in length. After the end of each round, american reinforcements spawn in the center of the base providing additional support. 
As the rounds continue, more and more soviets begin to surround the base making it harder to keep your soldiers alive. See how long
you can last by following the link below.
